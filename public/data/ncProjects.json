Incoherent messages lead to poor flow and important information gets lost, making it hard for families to organize. EduClass is a tool that optimizes communication between schools and families through a direct link, promoting transparency, security, and avoiding unnecessary conflicts. The target audience includes institutions and families with children aged between 3 and 12 years old (Preschool/Kindergarten and Primary School).",

        "highlight": "A notable feature is that parents or guardians can receive notifications from their children's school to stay informed about school activities and important dates. Additionally, they can view and track academic performance. Besides, in EduClass, there is the option to generate a digital authorization as a parent or guardian, allowing the institution to carry out specific activities. Also, there is the possibility to submit medical certificates or request student withdrawals directly through the platform.",
