            A few years ago, I began working in the culinary industry (now a
            meditative hobby), before venturing into the realm of Digital
            Marketing. While working in digital marketing, I got introduced to
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then, I have been meaning to learn
            more about web development.

            I spent most of my life in Ushuaia (Tierra del Fuego), then several
            years in Capital Federal (Buenos Aires), and finally, I rooted
            myself in the city of General Roca (RÃ­o Negro). Here, I started
            teaching flight lessons as a Flight Instructor. During the COVID-19
            pandemic, I took the opportunity to explore programming on my own.

            While working as a Marketing Manager, I decided to dive into Full
            Stack Development studies. I dedicate each day to learning something
            new. It's a journey I find both challenging and exciting. I am
            constantly seeking out new projects and challenges to expand my
            skills and knowledge in the world of web development.

            My goal is to become proficient in various programming languages and
            frameworks, and ultimately, to become a successful Full Stack
            Developer. I am passionate about creating innovative and
            user-friendly digital solutions, and I am excited to see where this
            journey in programming will take me.
