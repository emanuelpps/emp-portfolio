          A few years ago, I started by earning my first license as a Sports
          Pilot, then progressed to obtain my Commercial Pilot license. I
          initially worked in the culinary field (now a meditative hobby),
          before venturing into the realm of Digital Marketing. While working in
          digital marketing, I got introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          Since then, I have been meaning to learn more about web development.

          I spent most of my life in Ushuaia (Tierra del Fuego), then several
          years in Capital Federal (Buenos Aires), and finally, I rooted myself
          in the city of General Roca (RÃ­o Negro). Here, I started teaching flight lessons
          as a Flight Instructor. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I took the
          opportunity to explore programming on my own.

          While working as a Marketing Manager, I decided to dive into Full
          Stack Development studies. I dedicate each day to learning something
          new. It's a journey I find both challenging and exciting. I am
          constantly seeking out new projects and challenges to expand my skills
          and knowledge in the world of web development. My goal is to become
          proficient in various programming languages and frameworks, and
          ultimately, to become a successful Full Stack Developer. I am
          passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly digital
          solutions, and I am excited to see where this journey in programming
          will take me.
